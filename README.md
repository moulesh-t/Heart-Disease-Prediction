This project uses the Kaggle Heart Disease dataset to predict the presence of heart complications using various medical parameters.
The goal was to apply and understand different machine learning techniques for classification and model evaluation.

Through this project, I gained hands-on experience with:
1. Performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
2. Building data preprocessing and modeling pipelines for efficient workflow management.
3. Applying various classification algorithms and evaluating their performance.
4. Improving model accuracy through hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation.
